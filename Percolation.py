# The problem statement is as follows: 
# We model a percolation system using an n-by-n grid of sites. Each site is either open or blocked. 
# A full site is an open site that can be connected to an open site in the top row via a chain of 
# neighboring (left, right, up, down) open sites. We say the system percolates if there is a full site in the bottom 
# row. In other words, a system percolates if we fill all open sites connected to the top row and that process fills 
# some open site on the bottom row

# In a famous scientific problem, researchers are interested in the following question: if sites are independently 
# set to be open with probability p (and therefore blocked with probability 1 âˆ’ p), what is the probability that the 
# system percolates? When p equals 0, the system does not percolate; when p equals 1, the system percolates. 
# When n is sufficiently large, there is a threshold value p* such that when p < p* a random n-by-n grid almost 
# never percolates, and when p > p*, a random n-by-n grid almost always percolates. No mathematical solution for 
# determining the percolation threshold p* has yet been derived.


# What is the first step? Let's first create an n by n grid which has each square being blocked w a probability p

    General concept:
    -Start at a cell in the bottom row
    -Check to see if the cells to the left, right, up, and down are open
    -If so, priority is given to moving straight up, put the moves L,R, and D (if applicable) into a queue
    -After moving straight up, we repeat the process and add other moves further down the queue
    -Repeat this along one path until we get stuck (the only accpeted move is the opposite of the move we just did)
    -Go back to the most recent entry in the queue and repeat. Work backwards through the queue
    -If all surrounding cells have been visited then we need to toss that cell from the queue, since we have already explored all possible options

    Edge cases:
    -D is not an acceptable move on the first repitition
    -Handle when the current cell is on the edge of the board
    -Queue removal when a cell is surrounded by cells that have already been visited
